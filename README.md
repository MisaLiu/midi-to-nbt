# Midi to NBT

Turn any MIDI file into Minecraft's structure NBT file.

## Game preparation

1. Install Minecraft 1.20.1 with a mod loader
    * If you don't know what to choose, you can install the [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) modpack
2. Install mods from the [mods list](./server/mods.md)
3. Install resource packs from the [resource packs list](./server/resourcepacks/README.md)
4. Paste [KubeJS scripts](./server/kubejs/) into your game's KubeJS folder
5. Create a superflat world, and use `/setpiano` command to set piano position
    * Or you can skip that so there will have no visual effects but still play sounds
6. Enjoy!
